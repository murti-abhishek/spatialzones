# spatialzones

**Reads spatial transcriptomics input, computes tumor regions and tumor microenvironment zones, and visualizes region assignments.**

## Features

- ☐ Computes **inside / interface / outside tumor regions** using spatial transcriptomics data  
- ☐ Utilizes **nearest neighbors** to define spatial context  
- ☐ Visualizes region assignments and regional compositions of cell types  
- ☐ Supports plotting gene expression across regions

## Installation
